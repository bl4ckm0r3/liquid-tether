<h1>Introducing Liquid Tether</h1>

<h2>Modals made easy</h2>

<p>
  Liquid Tether combines the ideas behind <a>Ember Tether</a> with the power of
  <a>Liquid Fire</a> to provide an accessible, easy-to-use toolkit for both
  positioning & animating UI elements.

<div class="hello-world-container">
  <button {{action 'toggleHello'}} id="hello-world" class="btn btn-primary btn-embossed frontpage">
    Hello, World!
